Video Synchronization:
* Video Sync Methods can be improved upon by handling situations where the sync 
  frame chosen contains a difference.
    - A solution to this could be to identify a sync frame or a segment of 
      a sync frame that is reliably NOT a difference.
    - Another solution is to find a new sync frame if the end of the second
      video is reached before finding a matching frame. This would be less efficient.

* Explore more algorithms (DCT, MH, and radial pHash algorithms)
