____Video Synchronization:
ISSUE 1:
* Video Sync Methods can be improved upon by handling situations where the sync 
  frame chosen contains a difference (if this is the case, a matching frame 
  won't be found in the alt video).

  ===UPDATE: Joseph said there won't be any differences at the start of the video, 
  ===so we should need to worry about this item.
  Proposed solutions: (outdated, but keeping for record)
    • We may want to rely on using the timestamp at the bottom of the video to 
      sync up frames. This might be more reliable and would be faster since
      we would only be scanning a small number of pixels. However, due to the
      low quality of the video, this may not work with a high enough confidence
      threshold.
    • Another solution to this could be to identify a sync frame or a segment of 
      a sync frame that is reliably NOT a difference (like the heading line that 
      pops up around 10 seconds).
    • Another solution is to find a new sync frame if the end of the second
      video is reached before finding a matching frame. This would be less efficient.
  
ISSUE 2:
* Explore more algorithms
  ===UPDATE: DCT was explored and is not a good option.
            Average hash and simple subtraction were tested and performed similarly 
            to pixelwise.

____Difference Detection:
ISSUE 3:
* Explore possible algorithms for difference detection.
    • Block Mean Value Based Image Perceptual Hash (dHash)
    • Contour and Shape Analysis
    • Pre-trained Deep Learning-based Models such as:
        - You Only Look Once (Tested and not great, but we can train a model)
        - Single Shot Multibox Detector

ISSUE 4:
* Explore methods for applying algorithms.
    • Is it more efficient to segment the screen?
    • Is it more accurate to segment the screen?

ISSUE 5: 
* How do we plan on annotating the differences we detect?
