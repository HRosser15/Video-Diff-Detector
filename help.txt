## What are each of these programs?
- f_pixelwise.py is identical to pixelwise.py but it is slightly faster as it converts some frames to grayscale before the program enters a loop.

- Demo1 is a video player with no synchronization.
- Demo2 is the pixelwise video sync, but it shows every step the program takes to synchronize the videos.
- Demo3 is identical to pixelwise.py but has looser thresholds.

- Tests/logic_only contains scripts that use different methods for video synchronization. These specific scripts don't show any windows and don't print anything out. They are solely for testing execution time.
- Tests/logs contains logs of the execution time of the tests in tests/logic_only. The average execution time is logged at the bottom line of each file.

- optical_flow_analysis detects object movement in the video. It doesn't seem great for our use case due to the simplicity of our videos, but we can play around with it. We may be able to increase its sensitivity and use the annotations it makes to check for differences in each video and create bounding boxes or something.

## How do I run the programs?
1. open the VSCode terminal with 'CTRL + `'
2. 'python <program_name>.py' should run the program if it is in your current directory.
3. to run programs that aren't in your directory, you have two options, navigate to the directory or include the path in your command.
    - For video_sync_performance_test.py, it's in the test folder, so you can just use 'cd tests'. to step out of a folder you can use 'cd ..'
    - You can also include the path in the command, but this is different for different OS.
        * For Windows, \\ is used. 'python tests\\video_sync_performance_test.py'
        * For Mac orLinux / is used. 'python tests/video_sync_performance_test.py'
